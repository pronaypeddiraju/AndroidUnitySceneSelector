# AndroidUnitySceneSelector
Creating a native android app that provides a menu to launch Unity scenes

This project was an experiment to study methods of using native android controls in mobile applications made using Unity software. The primary challenge was to come up with methods to pass android intents to unity while using only UnityPlayerActivity for all forms of interaction.

Eventually, I was able to pass intents and use them in a singleton script within unity to help switch between scenes in the game.
